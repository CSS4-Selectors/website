    "description": "This pseudo-class is called **time-dimensional** and will select the time-dimensional relative element like during a speech rendering or during the display of [HTML5 video subtitles](https://gingertech.net/2008/12/12/attaching-subtitles-to-html5-video/ 'Attaching subtitles to HTML5 video'). All these selectors are similar to [`:is()`](https://css4-selectors.com/selector/css4/matches-any-pseudo-class/ 'CSS4: Matches Any Pseudo Class'), while the `:current` selector accepts additionally a simple selector list as argument. The difference between these 3 pseudo-classes is that `:past` will select all previous siblings of the `:current` element, self-explanatory that `:future` is for all next siblings.",
