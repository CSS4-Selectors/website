    "description": "Similar to [matches-any](https://css4-selectors.com/selector/css4/matches-any-pseudo-class/ 'CSS4: Matches Any Pseudo Class') this **specificity-adjustment** pseudo-class represents an element that is represented by its arguments (as selector list) just with a specificity of zero. This is helpful whenever a general matching is used but simple overwrites should still be possible.",
