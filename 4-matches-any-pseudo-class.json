    "description": "This pseudo-class is called **matches-any pseudo-class** and takes a [selector list](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#grouping 'W3C: Selector list') as argument. It lets you create sets of selectors by instituting groups which match all included selectors. Other pseudo-elements can't be represented with this pseudo-class, so e.g. negations may not be nested like this _invalid_ example: `E:is(:is(F))`. Please note this selector was previously named `:matches()`.",
